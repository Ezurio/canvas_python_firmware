# Erase Builds

**NOTE:** The builds in this directory **will erase** the contents of filesystems and secondary
bootloader update areas when executed. Only use these builds if you have a need to erase a
device. Once the firmware has finished erasing, it will print a `Board is erased` message.
At this point, the normal Canvas firmware should be reflashed onto the device. **Do not use**
these versions for normal Canvas development.
