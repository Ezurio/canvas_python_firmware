# Canvas and Connectivity Firmware Files
Both the Connectivity Firmware and Canvas Firmware image files (.rps) need to be flashed onto the brd2911a development board for the Canvas platform firmware to operate properly.
Use the Simplicity Commander tool (https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/simplicity-studio/simplicity-commander) to first flash the Connectivity Firmware .rps file, followed by the Canvas Firmware .rps file.

## Connectivity Firmware File
`SiWG917-B.2.13.4.1.0.4.rps`

## Canvas Firmware File
`brd2911a_0.0.99.1743535835_firmware.rps`
